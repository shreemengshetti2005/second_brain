# Second Brain

Second Brain is a personal knowledge management (PKM) starter repository designed to help you capture, organize, and retrieve ideas, notes, and project artifacts. It provides a simple, flexible structure and best-practice conventions so you can focus on thinking, not file management.

This README is intentionally written to be clear, practical, and human-centered — use it as a baseline and adapt it to your workflow.

## Why this repository

Our digital lives quickly accumulate fragmented notes, progress updates, and references. "Second Brain" is an approach to externalizing mental models so you can work more creatively and reliably. This repository captures a lightweight, opinionated template to bootstrap your own second brain using plain files and folders.

Key goals:
- Make note-taking intentional and searchable
- Encourage consistent organization and metadata
- Provide simple templates and examples to get started quickly

## What's included

- A recommended folder structure for notes, projects, and resources
- Templates for capturing ideas, meeting notes, and project plans
- Examples and guidance so the repository is a usable baseline, not an empty shell

> Note: This repo is intentionally general-purpose — adapt sections to tools you prefer (Obsidian, Notion, Markdown files, etc.).

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository

   git clone https://github.com/shreemengshetti2005/second_brain.git

2. Open the folder in your preferred editor (VS Code, Obsidian, etc.)

3. Explore the folders and the templates. Start by creating a note in the appropriate section and use the templates as a guide.

## Recommended structure

- notes/ — evergreen notes, literature notes, and concepts
- inbox/ — quick captures and unprocessed thoughts
- projects/ — active project work and plans
- resources/ — reference material, links, and bibliographies
- templates/ — note and project templates to keep entries consistent

Feel free to adjust names and nesting to match your workflow.

## Templates and conventions

Use a simple frontmatter or heading convention for metadata. Example:

---
title: Short descriptive title
date: 2025-12-22
tags: [topic, project]
status: draft
---

Or a heading-based approach if you prefer no frontmatter:

# Title
- Date: 2025-12-22
- Tags: topic, project
- Status: draft

Consistent metadata makes notes easier to filter and reuse.

## Usage tips

- Capture first, organize later: use the inbox to quickly dump ideas and process them weekly.
- Link related notes: create links between concepts to build a web of knowledge.
- Keep evergreen notes concise and focused on a single idea.
- Use tags sparingly and consistently.

## Contributing

Thank you for using this repository as the foundation of your Second Brain. Make it yours: iterate often, refine conventions, and keep the system lightweight so it actually gets used.
